In a lifelong journey of constant improvement, learning, solving some problems and most importantly having some fun along the way.

Currently interested in 
- Tech/AI
- Finance, money and economics
- Health and fitness 
- Nutrition, recipes and little bit about human physiology.

Through this blog I hope I can share some experiences and learnings that I have had. 


I also help small scale businesses and solo entrepreneurs establish their tech presence.

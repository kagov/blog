Currently based in London, I work as a software developer. 

Through this blog I hope I can share some experiences and learnings that I have had. I want to broadly cover various software systems
and how they interact with each other.

I will also be writing about productivity, lifestyle, personal finance and more..

I also help small scale businesses and solo entrepreneurs establish their tech presence.

Here is some of my work

I have been consistent and not consistent at the same time. <!--more--> I have been consistently finding waays to procrastinate the actual task of writing and as you can guess I have been not consistent with my writing.

I used to write more when I was younger. I simply put pen to paper and wrote random things. I wrote on Google docs, wrote on random pages using a pencil and I even wrote 50 pages of a novel that I never ever got back to.

Things were simpler back them. I was not boggled down by a milion ways to do things. This was before the realm of AI, productivity apps, note taking apps and a lot of tech that we currently have. In this sea of tools I have missed my core habit of writing. Writing for the joy of writing. Writing without caring where I am actually writing or what tool I am using to write.

I do get a lot of ideas. Probably slightly more than the average Joe. But I am also a lot more lazier that the average Joe. I think and I think and then I think some more. Only for the time around me to take control of my day. I have surrounded myself with a lot of tools both online and offline. I even have a big whiteboard where I note down (not) my ideas. I have some bullet points written there that are ideas for blog posts. They are still pending. The ink is so dry that I can't even erase those anymore (^^).

Even though I am not typing this out on a perfect note taking app or a perfect editor I am still fairly enjoying the process of just putting words on my IDE, something I need to remind myself of time and again. But while I am typing this my mind can't help but think how to make the writing experience more joyful and pleasant.

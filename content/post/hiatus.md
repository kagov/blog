I started writing here more that 7 years ago<!--more--> but I have been consistently inconsistent.

Over this time I have moved 2 countries, changed 3 jobs and also completed a Masters degree. Finding my
life partner was one of the best things that happened in my life.

I am currently based in London and working remotely for a e-commerce tech company. I have tried a few things
over this time but have not really been consistent.

I have been a binge consumer of content from all platforms. I also recently signed up for a paid writing
course but did not manage to complete it.

My plan now is to bring this blog back and keep up with a consistent writing habit.

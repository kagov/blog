For a while I have been planning to put down my thoughts on <!--more--> various topics that we all think about. I also want this post to be some sort of a time capsule which I can come back to so that I can have a peek into my past thoughts and correct course if needed.

## Relationships

Man is a social animal and there is no doubt that we all thrive on social contact. I have personally had days where my mood has been much better because I was surrounded by people.

Like everything in life friendships and relationships alos evolve. They change, strengthen, weaken and sometimes break off completely. I have heard a lot that people have to put equal effort in order to keep a relationship alive. But I disagree slightly.

I have gone from talking to some people daily to once in a year or two. We grew up, got jobs, got married and in some cases even have kids. Life got in the way and its not the same anymore. Sometimes the other person does not text or call you for months. I think that its okay for one person to put the effort and for the other person to not put the same amount. You are the one to call, you are the one to reach out and this might continue for years but if you feel like the relation is worth maintaining then you should keep making that effort and not expect reciprocation. 

The above is something I can only realise after a long time. After a few years its definitely worth coming back to this.
